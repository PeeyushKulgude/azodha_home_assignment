# Running a Flutter App

This guide will walk you through the steps to run a Flutter app on your local development environment. Flutter is a UI toolkit for building natively compiled applications for mobile, web, and desktop from a single codebase.

## Prerequisites

Before you can run a Flutter app, make sure you have the following prerequisites installed:

1. **Flutter SDK**: Install the Flutter SDK by following the official installation guide for your operating system:
   - [Flutter Installation Guide](https://flutter.dev/docs/get-started/install)

2. **Development Environment**: Set up a code editor or IDE for Flutter development. Popular choices include:
   - [Visual Studio Code (VSCode)](https://code.visualstudio.com/) with the Flutter and Dart extensions.
   - [Android Studio](https://developer.android.com/studio) with the Flutter plugin.

3. **Device or Emulator**: You can run Flutter apps on physical devices or emulators. Ensure you have a connected device or emulator set up:
   - [Setting Up Physical Device](https://flutter.dev/docs/get-started/install/windows#set-up-your-android-device)
   - [Setting Up Emulator](https://flutter.dev/docs/get-started/install/windows#set-up-the-android-emulator)

## Installation

Once you have met the prerequisites, follow these steps to install any necessary dependencies for your Flutter app:

1. Open a terminal or command prompt.

2. Navigate to your Flutter app's root directory using the `cd` command:
   ```bash
   cd /path/to/your/flutter_app

3. Install app dependencies using the flutter pub get command:
    ```bash
    flutter pub get

## Running the App

After installing the dependencies, you can run your Flutter app:

1. Ensure you are in the project directory where your Flutter app is located.

2. Use the flutter run command to start your app:
    ```bash
    flutter run

3. Flutter will build the app and launch it on your connected device or emulator.

4. You should see your app running in the device or emulator. Any changes you make to your code will automatically hot-reload into the running app, allowing you to see the results in real-time.
